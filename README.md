# Leekos' Munitions Merge

**A compatibility patch for [HAVOC's Ammo Maker Overhaul](https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1334716460618223699) and [Arti's Special Ammo](https://github.com/ilrathCXV/ArtiGrok-Ballistics-GAMMA-ilrath-Mo3) for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly GAMMA modpack.**  
Now with support for all of Arti’s ammo types and Pilli’s Honey Badger .300 framework.

---

## 📦 What This Patch Does

This mod merges and harmonizes the features of two major ammo mods for GAMMA:

- ✅ Full support for **Arti’s Special Ammo + Ammo Rebalance**  
- ✅ Compatibility with **HAVOC’s Ammo Maker Overhaul**
- ✅ Integrated support for **Pilli’s Honey Badger .300 Ammo Framework**
- ✅ Consistent progression and balance tuning
- ✅ Updated crafting costs and requirements

---

## 🔧 Changes to Arti Ammo Crafting

- **Anomalous Ammo** now uses **2x the base cost** (except casings) compared to standard AP/FMJ/HP rounds
- **Non-anomalous alternatives** have been rebalanced to match Ammo Maker Overhaul standards
- **Ammo crafting materials** vary by ammo type  
  - _Example:_ `.357 Headhunter` uses **shotgun gunpowder**  
  - _Example:_ `Fury Rounds` use **sniper gunpowder and AR casings**
- **All recipes are unlockable via Ammo Maker Overhaul progression.**  
  Arti’s old recipe books have been deprecated to keep things streamlined. Unlocking Tier 1 now grants access to **Tier 1 anomalous ammo**, etc.
  - If needed, a future patch will remove recipe dependencies.

## 🧪 Balancing Notes

Some items may still be unbalanced.  
🧪 **Testing and feedback are appreciated!** Report bugs, odd values, or missing recipes.
